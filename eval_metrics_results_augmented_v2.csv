Explanation:
- The document provides information about an investment in ""BWE Kaia"", but does not contain any explicitly stated fund-level performance metrics such as Net IRR, Net MOIC, or Net DPI. 
- The document refers to ""Initial Investment Commitment"" and ""2025 Return of Capital"", but these are not equivalent to the requested fund-level performance metrics.
- Since no fund-level performance figures are reported, I have set net_irr, net_moic, and net_dpi to null.
- The asset class is inferred to be ""Private Equity"" based on the nature of the investment.
- The vintage year is listed as 2020.
- The ""performance_summary"" field is left as null since no evaluation of outperformance or underperformance can be made without fund-level metrics.
- The key details extracted are the initial investment amount, the lack of fund-level performance reporting, and the note about historical distributions.","[250000.0, 2020.0, 250000.0, 2025.0, 2020.0]",,,1,,,1,,,1,,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
