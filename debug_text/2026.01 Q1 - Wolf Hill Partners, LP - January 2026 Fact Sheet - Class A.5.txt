WOLF HILL CAPITAL FIRM OVERVIEW
CONFIDENTIAL: DO NOT COPY OR REDISTRIBUTEDISCLAIMER:
This material does not constitute an offer or solicitation to purchase an interest in (i) Wolf Hill Partners, LP or (ii) Wolf Hill Offshore Fund, Ltd. (collectively
the "Funds"). Such an offer will only be made by means of a confidential offering memorandum and only in those jurisdictions where permitted by law. An
investment in the Funds is speculative and is subject to a risk of loss, including a risk of loss of principal. There is no secondary market for interests in the
Funds and none is expected to develop. No assurance can be given that the Funds will achieve its objective or that an investor will receive a return of all or
part of its investment. This document is being provided to you for informational purposes only on a confidential basis and may not be delivered to any
person without the consent of Wolf Hill Capital Management, LP. The information contained herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the more detailed discussion contained in the Funds’ offering documents.
The performance data discussed herein represents the asset weighted net returns of the separately managed accounts (“Wolf Hill Capital Composite”)
managed by Wolf Hill Capital Management, LLC (former RIA with the State of New York) from inception on March 9, 2017 through December 31, 2018. In
addition, the performance data discussed includes the actual net returns offered from Wolf Hill Partners, LP, the onshore fund managed by Wolf Hill Capital
Management, LP (RIA with the SEC converted from Wolf Hill Capital Management, LLC) from inception on February 1, 2019 to present. Both the Wolf Hill
Capital Composite and Funds have the same strategy; moreover, Wolf Hill Capital Management, LP launched Wolf Hill Offshore Fund, Ltd at the same time
as the onshore fund. Note - the separately managed accounts were liquidated in early January 2019 and reinvested into the Funds on February 1, 2019, so
both the separately managed accounts and the Funds were not invested during the month of January 2019.
For the period March 9, 2017 through December 31, 2017, the Wolf Hill Capital Composite composed of fully discretionary separately managed accounts and
these accounts were managed on a pari-passu basis. For the period beginning January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, the “Insider Account” (which is
comprised of personal funds from the principal of Wolf Hill) was not traded pari-passu with the other accounts, resulting in different performance of the
Insider Account from the performance of the other accounts, therefore, it was excluded from the Wolf Hill Capital Composite Index throughout 2018.
Additionally, results shown are based on fully discretionary accounts under management excluding managed accounts no longer with the firm.
The performance results from March 2017 to December 2018 reflect the audited asset weighted net returns of Class F (the “Founders Class”) and the
performance results from February 2019 to July 2020 reflect the actual net returns of Class F with actual deductions of: (i) an annual asset management fee
of 1.25%, charged quarterly in arrears, (ii) a 12% performance allocation, taken annually, subject to a “high water mark.” The performance results shown
from August 2020 through October 2022 reflect the actual net returns of Class A (the old “Standard Class”) with actual deduction of: (i) an annual asset
management fee of 1.50%, charged quarterly in arrears, (ii) a 20% performance allocation, taken annually, subject to a “high water mark.” The performance
results shown from November 2022 and beyond reflect the actual net returns of Class A.5 (the latest “Standard Class”) with actual deduction of: (i) an
annual asset management fee of 1.75%, charged quarterly in arrears, (ii) a 20% performance allocation, taken annually, subject to a “high water mark.” The
listed net returns include dividends, interest, fund expenses, and all other expenses actually incurred by the Funds with no subsequent capital additions or
withdrawals. Note, the 2020 YTD result reflect the hybrid returns of both the Founders Class and Standard Class. The results shown reflect the
implementation of the investment strategy described in the Fund’s offering documents. In addition, the SMA and Funds were not invested during this
transition period in January 2019, thus, the returns from this period was excluded from the 2019 YTD and ITD returns for both the Funds and the indices
represented.
Results are compared to the performance of the S&P 500 Index (the “S&P 500”) and Russell 2000 Index (the “Russell 2000”) for informational purposes only.
The Funds’ investment program does not mirror the S&P 500 or Russell 2000, and the volatility of the Funds’ investment program may be materially different
from that of the S&P 500 and Russell 2000. The securities or other instruments included in the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 are not necessarily included in the
Funds’ investment program and criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500 or Russell 2000 are different from those for investment by the Funds. The performance
of the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 were obtained from published sources believed to be reliable, but which are not warranted as to accuracy or completeness.
The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 returns shown exclude the results from January 2019 to reflect the same investment periods as Wolf Hill Capital Composite
Index and Wolf Hill Funds.
The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS®) is a common global classification standard used by thousands of market participants across all major
groups involved in the investment process and a method for assigning companies to a specific economic sector and industry group that best defines its
business operations. GICS was developed jointly by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) and Standard & Poor's. The GICS methodology is used by
the MSCI indexes, which include U.S. and international stocks, as well as by a large portion of the professional investment management community.
This material contains certain forward-looking statements and projections regarding the future asset allocation of the Funds. These projections are included
for illustrative purposes only, are inherently speculative as they relate to future events, and may not be realized as described. These forward-looking
statements will not necessarily be updated in the future. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.
