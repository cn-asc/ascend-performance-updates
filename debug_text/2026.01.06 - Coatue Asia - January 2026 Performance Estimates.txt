Please note the above estimate does not account for the final review of our private portfolio. Any such adjustments will be included in the final performance as noted on the 
official month end statement provided by our administrator. As a result, final performance will vary and could vary significantly from the estimates presented herein. 
Past performance numbers are not indicative or a guarantee of future results. No representation is made that the portfolio will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar  
to those shown herein. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate and, as a result, at the time of redemption may be worth more or less than the 
original principal invested.
