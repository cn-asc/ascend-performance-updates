    "At underwriting in December 2023, Boram was projected to generate ~$2.5M of revenue in 2023 and scale to ~$9.9M in 2025, driven primarily by rapid expansion of Boram Retreats, meaningful contribution from Boram Anywhere (~26% of revenue), and improving gross margins to ~32% with net profitability by 2025. The company has completely pivoted business models, and it is a little too early to tell whether they will succeed; but we consider the company to be underperforming based on its revenue and margin profile.",
    "s of December 2025, Boram has generated ~$1.54M in cumulative gross booking sales year-to-date and ~$694K in completed (recognized) revenue, materially below original 2025 revenue expectations.",
    "While top-line scale has underperformed underwriting projections, actual unit-level performance remains strong, with ARPU of ~$8.4K and LTV of ~$1.67K+.",
    "The business remains cash flow negative at the operating level, with monthly net losses in the ~$65K\u2013$110K range and an end-of-year cash balance of ~$342K, contrasting with underwriting expectations that envisioned net profitability in 2025."

    "Cash runway is limited to February\u2013March 2026, making near-term fundraising execution critical to avoid operational disruption."
