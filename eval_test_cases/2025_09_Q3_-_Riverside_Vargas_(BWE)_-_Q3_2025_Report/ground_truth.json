    "Riverside Vargas (BWE) is an early-stage development investment; as of Q3 2025 there are no fund-level Net IRR, Net MOIC, or Net DPI metrics available, as the project has not yet begun operations or generated cash flow.",

    "The overall development budget totals $102.7 million, with $24.3 million (23.7%) spent to date and $78.3 million remaining, indicating the project is still in the early construction phase.",

  "key_takeaways": [
    "The investment has successfully transitioned from pre-development to active construction, materially reducing entitlement and execution risk following permit approvals and loan closing.",
    "With construction just underway and no income generation yet, performance should be evaluated primarily on milestone achievement and budget adherence, both of which are currently tracking as planned.",
    "The GMP with Skybeck remains unchanged at $64.5 million, with no approved change orders to date, supporting cost certainty at this stage of development.",
    "Significant remaining contingency ($5.7 million total) provides downside protection against construction cost inflation or unforeseen issues during the build phase."

  "business_updates": [
    "Construction officially commenced on September 8, 2025, following issuance of the Notice to Proceed to Skybeck, with site preparation and earthwork now underway at the Austin Riverside location.",
    "All major site development and building permits have been secured, and nearly all easements and license agreements have been finalized, clearing key regulatory hurdles.",
    "The project has been rebranded as \u201cThe Grant\u201d, with updated branding and marketing materials to be shared in future investor updates, supporting future lease-up positioning.",
    "The current construction schedule targets first unit delivery in October 2027 and final close-out by February 2028, setting expectations for a longer-duration, development-oriented investment profile."
