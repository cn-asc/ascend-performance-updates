    "Fund IV generated an 11% Net IRR and 1.1\u20131.2x Net MOIC / TVPI from inception (June 2023) through September 30, 2025, with Net DPI of ~0.03x (3% of called capital) reflecting the early life of the fund and growing but still modest realizations.",
    "Performance this quarter was driven primarily by Secondary and Direct investments, which benefit from more seasoned credit profiles and current income, while Primary commitments remain early in their J-curves (~0.9x net MOIC).",
    "The Fund has called 48% of $601M total commitments and distributed $5.8M in Q3, with management targeting an additional ~2% distribution by year-end 2025.",
    "Direct portfolio metrics remain conservative, with ~12.7% weighted average coupon, all investments current on interest, and leverage at ~3.8\u20134.0x, below broader LMM benchmarks.",
    "Exit momentum is emerging earlier than expected, including a full refinance-driven exit in women\u2019s health (1.2\u20131.3x net MOIC, ~17% net IRR) and a subsequent full exit in in-home healthcare at similar returns, validating the downside-protected credit-first strategy."

  "key_takeaways": [
    "Underwriting emphasized Secondaries and Directs to reduce early J-curve drag; this is playing out, with Secondaries and Directs driving nearly all current performance and cash yield while Primaries remain early.",
    "Fund IV has outperformed a blended high-yield and leveraged loan benchmark (~10%) despite early-stage drag from Primary investments, underscoring the value of the diversified Primary / Secondary / Direct structure.",
    "Our underwriting highlighted that DPI would lag peers early due to SBIC structure; current DPI profile is fully consistent with this known risk and not indicative of underperformance. DPI focus is increasing, with management explicitly highlighting improved M&A conditions, rising strategic buyer interest, and multiple portfolio companies entering sale processes, which should support faster distribution velocity in 2026.",
    "Portfolio fundamentals remain strong, with LTM revenue up ~7.6% and EBITDA up ~5.6%, and no evidence of systemic credit stress across holdings."

    "M&A activity accelerated meaningfully starting September 2025, supported by pent-up demand following rate cuts and renewed engagement from both private equity and well-capitalized strategic buyers moving down-market."
